Library for handling the user identification.

## Concepts


#### Account

The primary goal of any authentication system is to verify the ownership of an account. User's account is the structure in your application to which you associate information about said user. This association can be direct (when the `Account` entity contains all you know about the user) or implemented using composition (when `Account` entity contains other entities, like `Profile`&nbsp;and&nbsp;`History`).

Palladium does not restrict you to any specific approach of defining user accounts. To use your existing account management system with it, the only requirement is for the account entity to implement the [`HasId`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Contract/HasId.php) interface. This interface is used to link one or more user identities with user's&nbsp;account.

#### Identity

In context of this library, an `Identity` is a named resource, that you can claim to own by providing a secret, which has been associated with this identity. At any given moment a user account can have multiple active identities (same account can have multiple ways to log in). And you have an ability to deactivate any specific identity or all identities, that have been associated with a specific&nbsp;account.

The current version of the library contains 3 different identity types:

 - **EmailIdentity**: your basic form of email + password authentication approach
 - **NonceIdentity**: single-use authentication
 - **CookieIdentity**: used for "relogin" and always contains a parent identity's id (either one-time or email)

## Installation

You can add the library to your project using composer with following command:

```sh
composer require teresko/palladium
```

To use this package, it require PHP version 7.0+ and PDO.

You will also need to create a table, where to store the **identities**. The example schema is available [here](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/resources/schema.sql). It currently contains only table definition for MySQL/MariaDB, but the library can be used with any RDBMS, that has a PDO driver.

## Initialization

Palladium contains 4 services: `Registration`, `Identification`, `Search` and `Recovery`. Each of these services has two&nbsp;mandatory&nbsp;dependencies:  

 - mapper factory (that implements `Palladium\Contract\CanCreateMapper`)
 - logger (that implements `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface`)


 This gives you an option to replace the default  [`MapperFactory`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Component/MapperFactory.php), if you want to alter or replace parts of persistence abstraction&nbsp;layer. As for logger - the recommended approach is to use [Monolog](https://packagist.org/packages/monolog/monolog), but it would work with any compatible logging&nbsp;system.

#### Optional parameters

In the constructor of `Identification` service there is also an optional third parameter: lifespan of the cookie (in seconds). It defaults to 4 hours.


#### Setting up mapper factory

To start using any of the services, you will need to pass a `MapperFactory` instance as a dependency. The included factory itself has two dependencies: `PDO` instance and the name of table, where the **identities** will be stored.

```php
<?php

$factory = new \Palladium\Component\MapperFactory(new \PDO(...$config), $tableName);
```

In every other example, where you see `$factory` variable used, you can assume, that it has been initialized using this code sample.

## Usage

#### Registration of new email identity

```php
<?php

$registration = new \Palladium\Service\Registration($factory, $logger);

$identity = $registration->createEmailIdentity('foo@bar.com', 'password');
$registration->bindAccountToIdentity($accountId, $identity);
```

If operation is completed successfully, the `$identity` variable will contain an instance of unverified [`EmailIdentity`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Entity/EmailIdentity.php). To complete verification, you will have to use the token, that the identity contains. In the give example, this token can be assessed using&nbsp;`$instance->getToken()`.

The `createEmailIdentity()` method can throw  [`IdentityConflict`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityConflict.php) exception, if email has already used for a another&nbsp;identity.

The `createEmailIdentity()` method has an optional third parameter, that defines the lifespan on the email verification token in seconds. When applied, the previous example looks as following:

```php
<?php

$registration = new \Palladium\Service\Registration($factory, $logger);

$identity = $registration->createEmailIdentity('foo@bar.com', 'password', 3600);
$registration->bindAccountToIdentity($accountId, $identity);
```

This will make the verification token usable for 1 hour after this user's identity has been registered. After that given time passes, you won't be able to find this identity using the `findEmailIdentityByToken()` in the `Search` service.

#### Verification of email identity

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$registration = new \Palladium\Service\Registration($factory, $logger);

$identity = $search->findEmailIdentityByToken($token, \Palladium\Entity\Identity::ACTION_VERIFY);
$registration->verifyEmailIdentity($identity);
```

The `$token` value is used to locate the matching [`EmailIdentity`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Entity/EmailIdentity.php), which then gets verified. If the identity is not found, the `findEmailIdentityByToken()` will throw [`IdentityNotFound`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityNotFound.php) exception.

#### Login with email and password

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$identification = new \Palladium\Service\Identification($factory, $logger);

$identity = $search->findEmailIdentityByEmailAddress($emailAddress);
$cookie = $identification->loginWithPassword($identity, $password);
```

If there is no matching identity with given email address found, the `findEmailIdentityByEmailAddress()` method will throw [`IdentityNotFound`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityNotFound.php) exception.

In case, if password does not match, the `loginWithPassword()` method will throw [`PasswordMismatch`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/PasswordMismatch.php) exception.

#### Creation of new single-use login

```php
<?php

$identity = $this->registration->createNonceIdentity($accountId);
```

This will create a new instance of `NonceIdentity`. To use it for login, you will need values in `NonceIdentity::getIdentifier()` and `NonceIdentity::getKey()`, where the identifier will be used to locate the nonce identity and key will be used to verify.

The `createNonceIdentity()` method was an optional second parameter, that defines the lifespan this single-use identity in seconds. When applied, the previous example looks as following:

```php
<?php

$identity = $this->registration->createNonceIdentity($accountId, 600);
```

This will make the single-use identity usable for 10 minutes after its creation. After the allowed time has passed, passing this identity in `useNonceIdentity()` method of `Identification` will result in [`IdentityExpired`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityExpired.php) exception being thrown.

#### Login with nonce

```php
<?php

$identity = $this->search->findNonceIdentityByIdentifier($identifier);
$cookie = $this->identification->useNonceIdentity($identity, $key);
```

If there is no matching identity with given email address found, the `findNonceIdentityByIdentifier()` method will throw [`IdentityNotFound`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityNotFound.php) exception.

In case, if password does not match, the `useNonceIdentity()` method will throw [`KeyMismatch`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/KeyMismatch.php) exception.


#### Login using cookie

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$identification = new \Palladium\Service\Identification($factory, $logger);

$identity = $search->findCookieIdentity($accountId, $series);
$cookie = $identification->loginWithCookie($identity, $key);
```

If cookie is not found using `findCookieIdentity()` a standard [`IdentityNotFound`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityNotFound.php) exception will be thrown. The possible caused for it would be either cookie not being active anymore (e.g. user logged out) or cookie not existing at all.

In case, if cookie is too old, `loginWithCookie()` will produce [`IdentityExpired`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityExpired.php) exception.

But the `loginWithCookie()` method can also produce [`CompromisedCookie`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/CompromisedCookie.php) exception. Seeing an exception for this **could indicate, that cookie has been stolen** or that user never received a new cookie value.


#### Blocking a compromised cookie

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$identification = new \Palladium\Service\Identification($factory, $logger);

$identity = $search->findCookieIdentity($accountId, $series);
$identification->blockIdentity($identity);
```

This is the recommended way for dealing with suspicious cookies, that might or might not be stolen. This is **not intended for logging out users**.

#### Logout

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$identification = new \Palladium\Service\Identification($factory, $logger);

$identity = $search->findCookieIdentity($accountId, $series);
$identification->logout($identity, $key);
```

This operation marks the cookie as "discarded". The list of exception, that can be produced, match the ones described in [login using cookie](#login-using-cookie) section.

#### Initiating password reset process

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$recovery = new \Palladium\Service\Recovery($factory, $logger);

$identity = $search->findEmailIdentityByEmailAddress($emailAddress);
$token = $recovery->markForReset($identity);
```

If there is no matching identity with given email address found, the `findEmailIdentityByEmailAddress()` method will throw [`IdentityNotFound`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityNotFound.php) exception.

When `markForReset()` is called, it must be provided with an email identity, that has already been verified (otherwise, it has a potential to leak user's private information from your application). If that is not the case, the method will throw [`IdentityNotVerified`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityNotVerified.php) exception.

The `markForReset()` method was an optional second parameter, that defines the lifespan on the password reset token in seconds. When applied, the previous example looks as following:

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$recovery = new \Palladium\Service\Recovery($factory, $logger);

$identity = $search->findEmailIdentityByEmailAddress($emailAddress);
$token = $recovery->markForReset($identity, 7200);
```

This will make the password reset token usable for two hours after this user's identity has been marked for reset. When the allowed time has expired, you won't be able to find this identity using the `findEmailIdentityByToken()` in the `Search` service.

#### Completion of password reset

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$recovery = new \Palladium\Service\Recovery($factory, $logger);

$identity = $search->findEmailIdentityByToken($token, \Palladium\Entity\Identity::ACTION_RESET);
$recovery->resetIdentityPassword($identity, 'foobar');
```

If there is no matching identity with given token found, the `findEmailIdentityByToken()` method will throw [`IdentityNotFound`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityNotFound.php) exception.

#### Changing password of email identity

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$identification = new \Palladium\Service\Identification($factory, $logger);

$identity = $search->findEmailIdentityByEmailAddress($emailAddress);
$identification->changePassword($identity, $oldPassword, $newPassword);
```

If there is no matching identity with given email address found, the `findEmailIdentityByEmailAddress()` method will throw [`IdentityNotFound`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/IdentityNotFound.php) exception.

In case, if the password does not match, the `changePassword()` method will throw [`PasswordMismatch`](https://github.com/teresko/palladium/blob/master/src/Palladium/Exception/PasswordMismatch.php) exception.

#### Logging out identities in bulk

```php
<?php

$search = new \Palladium\Service\Search($factory, $logger);
$identification = new \Palladium\Service\Identification($factory, $logger);

$list = $search->findIdentitiesByParentId($identity->getId());
$identification->discardIdentityCollection($list);
```

The return value of `findIdentitiesByParentId()` will return `IdentityCollection`, which can be empty.

## Logging of user activity

As previously mentioned, the services in this library expect a [PSR-3 compatible](https://github.com/php-fig/log) logger as a dependency. It will be utilized to log three levels of events:

#### `LogLevel::INFO`

This log-level is used for tracking ordinary operations, that user would perform, when using your application in the intended manner:

 - successful registration
 - successful password recover
 - successful login (with email or cookie) or logout
 - successful email verification
 - use of expired cookie or nonce

#### `LogLevel::NOTICE`

Logs with this level will be recorded, if user attempted an unsuccessful operation, that should not happed in correct usage scenarios:

 - all cases, when identity was not found
 - incorrect password was entered
 - email already used for different identity
 - attempt to recover password using unverified email

#### `LogLevel::WARNING`

Only used for logging cases, when user attempted to use a compromised cookie.



## Additional notes

This library focuses on one specific task. It **does not** include any of the following functionality:

 - account creation and management
 - authorization system
 - validation of user input (including emails and passwords)
 - logging framework

If you think, that authentication library requires one of the above listed parts, then this is not the library that you are looking for.
